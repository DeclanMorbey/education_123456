# How To Git Good
Do you want to become a better version of yourself?
This should contain education materials used throughout the course of a degree in physics.
In order to create this comprehensive course, the material should be deisgned to the same stucture. 
It should all be written in a Latex format, with a title page, contents page, and an abstract overview with what will be covered.  

# How to contribute in an orderly fashion 

In short to add to the knowledge:

1. Create your own branch (eg. `user_how_to_git_good`, `user_subject`).
2. Decide on the category of the sub-subject, or create a new subject folder.
3. Create a `subsubject.tex` file with your desired sub-subject.
4. Add this sub-subject to the `main_subject.tex` file using `\input{filename}` feature in Latex.

The purpose of compiling these files this way is so that upon compilation,
people are able to pick and choose what subjects to include in the output `pdf`.
First remember that this is meant to be an incredible resource for both yourself and others.
As with any notes, you want to be able to look back and understand why you wrote notes on a topic. 
It will be of great importance to ask yourself "What question is this answering?"
and "What is the purpose of knowing this material?" - this may help you learn it more effectively!
It may also be handy to create beamer slides at any point, 
where you wish to present the information to an audience or teach.
